          <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">How could we get involved with more events for beginners like this?</h4>
          <p class="list-group-item-text">There's lots of places to find local events -- some are good, some are bad, and you never know until you have a go. There is <a href="http://eventbrite.com" target="_blank">Eventbrite</a> and <a href="http://meetup.com" target="_blank">Meetup.com</a> as well. If all else fails, you can also organise your own meetup. There is also a <a href="http://open.glasgow.gov.uk/hackathon/hackathon-no4/" target="_blank">hackathon</a> in Glasgow coming up that you can go to. You do not have to be a skilled coder to go to these; any and all skills you can bring to the table are useful -- ideas, copywriting, testing, design, psychology, they're all useful!</p>

        <li class="list-group-item" id="q-next-4">
          <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Where can we go to keep learning more?</h4>
          <p class="list-group-item-text">...</p>
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item" id="q-philosophy">
          <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">How do you get past the frustration of constantly having to scour for mistakes + how to motivate yourself and avoid rage quitting?</h4>
          <p class="list-group-item-text">This is a danger when you first start to code. As you practice, the syntax mistakes will hopefully lessen and become easier to spot. You'll learn to recognise the patterns of the code and the way SublimeText colours the different elements, so you'll be able to fix mistakes as they happen rather than scouring for them later. Errors will still happen, of course, but the more you code, the easier it will become to look for them. You can always ask for help on StackOverflow also, or ask one of the instructors to have a look at the code you've written. Sometimes a second pair of eyes can be the most helpful solution. As for motivation, you'll find that once you start, coding can be pretty addictive. Motivation comes from finally solving the problem, locating the error you made, or finding a new solution that worked better than what you've tried before. It can come from finding a new course to take or a new tool out on the web to use to solve those problems. Rage quitting will happen sometimes, and it's sometimes even helpful to take a bit of time away from the code.</p>

          <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">What is a typical web designer - client relationship like? Business context for a freelancer?</h4>
          <p class="list-group-item-text">A relationship with a client is one that will always depend on the client themselves, and the nature of the project. Dealing with a larger company will be very different to dealing with a local business, but many of the basic principles will be the same. <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/10/15/identifying-and-dealing-with-different-types-of-clients/" target="_blank">This article</a> by Smashing Magazine is a good source on how to identify and deal with different types of clients. The key is always to remember that what you are doing is a specialised skill, and should be compensated as such-- don't undersell yourself! Be organised and confident in your communications with each client, even if things go wrong. There can and will be bad clients, but if you conduct yourself professionally, you'll be able to come out of those interactions mostly unscathed.</p>
