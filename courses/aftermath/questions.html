        <li class="list-group-item" id="q-contact">
          <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">How can we keep in touch?</h4>
          <p class="list-group-item-text">You can keep in touch with others via the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/869480249736072/" target="_blank">Facebook group</a>, or e-mail your instructors, <a href="mailto:ivana@stipso.com">Ivana</a> and <a href="mailto:alan@armoin.com">Alan</a> for any specific questions.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item" id="q-material">
          <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Can we get links to everyone's websites?</h4>
          <p class="list-group-item-text">Yes, if you'd like to have a link to your site (or any subsequent sites you develop) up for others to see, send a link to the main page to <a href="mailto:alan@armoin.com">Alan</a> and he'll add it to this site and place the link into the Facebook group</p>
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item" id="q-next-1">
          <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Where do we go from here? Where are the next steps? Are there any follow-up classes/events? Are there plans for more advanced website creation and/or programming events to be offered?</h4>
          <p class="list-group-item-text">In a word, no. Not yet at any rate. Checking your inboxes for information from CodeFirst:Girls would be the best bet. There <em>may</em> be something when the next term starts. If so, we will let you know on the Facebook group page.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item" id="q-next-2">
          <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">How could we get involved with more events for beginners like this?</h4>
          <p class="list-group-item-text">There's lots of places to find local events -- some are good, some are bad, and you never know until you have a go. There is <a href="http://eventbrite.com" target="_blank">Eventbrite</a> and <a href="http://meetup.com" target="_blank">Meetup.com</a> as well. If all else fails, you can also organise your own meetup. There are also semi-regular hackathons that you can go to. You do not have to be a skilled coder to go to these; any and all skills you can bring to the table are useful -- ideas, copywriting, testing, design, psychology, they're all useful!</p>
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item" id="q-next-3">
          <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Where can we go to keep learning more?</h4>
          <p class="list-group-item-text">The best place is to refer to the <a href="resources.html">Resources</a> page. This gives links to a bunch of materials that you can use to further your learning.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item" id="q-philosophy">
          <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">How do you get past the frustration of constantly having to scour for mistakes + how to motivate yourself and avoid rage quitting?</h4>
          <p class="list-group-item-text">This is a danger when you first start to code. As you practice, the syntax mistakes will hopefully lessen and become easier to spot. You'll learn to recognise the patterns of the code and the way SublimeText colours the different elements, so you'll be able to fix mistakes as they happen rather than scouring for them later. Errors will still happen, of course, but the more you code, the easier it will become to look for them. You can always ask for help on StackOverflow also, or ask one of the instructors to have a look at the code you've written. Sometimes a second pair of eyes can be the most helpful solution. As for motivation, you'll find that once you start, coding can be pretty addictive. Motivation comes from finally solving the problem, locating the error you made, or finding a new solution that worked better than what you've tried before. It can come from finding a new course to take or a new tool out on the web to use to solve those problems. Rage quitting will happen sometimes, and it's sometimes even helpful to take a bit of time away from the code.</p>

          <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Should you keep your laptop plugged in/out at all times?</h4>
          <p class="list-group-item-text">I'm not an expert I'm afraid. Whenever I find myself in this situation I turn to the Googles who, in their infinite wisdom, have suggested that you try <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5875162/how-often-should-i-charge-my-gadgets-battery-to-prolong-its-lifespan">this article</a></a> </p>

          <p class="list-group-item-text">We would suggest <a href="edinburghhacklab.com" target="_blank">Edinburgh HackLab</a>.</p>

        <li class="list-group-item" id="q-random-3">
          <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Is there any other free web hosting domain to use?</h4>
          <p class="list-group-item-text">There are, but most of them require you to either have a server-side app built in the likes of Rails or Node (i.e. Heroku, DigitalOcean) or to have a reasonably advanced knowledge of server setup/maintenance (i.e. Amazon EC2, Amazon S3)</p>
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item" id="q-random-4">
          <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">What is a typical web designer - client relationship like? Business context for a freelancer?</h4>
          <p class="list-group-item-text">A relationship with a client is one that will always depend on the client themselves, and the nature of the project. Dealing with a larger company will be very different to dealing with a local business, but many of the basic principles will be the same. <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/10/15/identifying-and-dealing-with-different-types-of-clients/" target="_blank">This article</a> by Smashing Magazine is a good source on how to identify and deal with different types of clients. The key is always to remember that what you are doing is a specialised skill, and should be compensated as such-- don't undersell yourself! Be organised and confident in your communications with each client, even if things go wrong. There can and will be bad clients, but if you conduct yourself professionally, you'll be able to come out of those interactions mostly unscathed.</p>

        <li class="list-group-item" id="q-review">
          <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Has it all sinked in? Too much too quickly?</h4>
          <p class="list-group-item-text">Yes, we appreciate that it was probably a bit of a firehose. Hopefully you'll be able to start learning now at your own pace and come back to these materials as you go for more info. I think if we do this again we'll take a more measured approach. :)</p>
